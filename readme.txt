### INTRODUCTION
Resume Screening is the process of examining a resume to determine if the candidate is qualified or not. Resume Screening is a vital step for a candidate to check their eligibility to do a job in a certain field. Traditionally, this procedure takes much time and effort to manually evaluate every single resume. A resume plays an important role as it displays more about the skills and experience of a person during the hiring process. Making this process automated helps
recruiters screen the profiles of candidates and reduces time and effort. This paper primarily discusses the usage of machine learning models to predict the job category a candidate is suitable for. It also tells about the working of a Python application to evaluate a resume and predict a candidate job category. This process is user-friendly and displays the prediction in no time to the user. The paper explains in detail the process of evaluating a resume by trained models and displaying it to the user through a web interface.
